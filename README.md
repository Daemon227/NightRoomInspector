**Night Room Inspector**
2D pixel-art puzzle horror focused on a chatbox UI — scan, interrogate, decide. Playable on WebGL and PC app.

Introduction
You are unemployed and happen to find a flyer recruiting for a night room inspector at an old lodging house. The contract is only 4 nights, but the salary is suspiciously high. The job sounds simple: clean up if dirty, check all tenants, and report to the landlord if you notice anything unusual. However, among these tenants lurk beings known as “Impostors” — they are not human. Each night, all tenants become increasingly distorted and grotesque.
The game features 3 different endings depending on the choices you make.

**Key Features**
• Short horror narrative: 4 nights of tense gameplay with branching choices.
• 3 Endings: your reports, trust level, and actions affect the outcome.
• Multiple interactions: pick up/examine items, chat with tenants, scan bodies, and shoot when suspicious.
• Pixel art 2D: moody atmosphere, worn-down rooms, and unsettling details.
• Chatbox-driven gameplay: interrogation and deduction through dialogue.
• Cross-platform: runs on WebGL (browser) and PC app.
⚠️ Content Warning: Horror themes, body distortion, sudden audio/visual scares. Player discretion advised.

**Gameplay**
1. Night shift: patrol the corridor, clean rooms if dirty, check tenants one by one.
2. Observe & note: track suspicious behavior, lies, environmental inconsistencies
3. Body scan: use the scanner to detect biological anomalies.
4. Chat interrogation: choose questions/answers in the chatbox to pressure or calm suspects.
5. Decide: REPORT (suspected), IGNORE, or ACT (restrain/shoot) if danger is high.
6. Consequences: your choices affect trust, transformations, available resources, and the ending.

**Core Mechanics**
• Suspicion system: suspicion rises/falls based on tenant behavior, dialogue, and scans.
• Scan & match: compare scan results with tenant records (structural anomalies…).
• Items: light switch, scan machine, gun
• Daily reports: submit a written report each night, selecting tenants and evidence.
