## 📖 Introduction

You are unemployed and stumble upon a flyer recruiting a **Night Room Inspector** for an old lodging house. The contract lasts only **4 nights**, but the salary is suspiciously high.

The job sounds simple:

* 🧹 Clean the room if dirty
* 🚪 Check each tenant
* 📑 Report anything unusual

However, among the tenants lurk beings called **"Impostors"** — not human. Each night, they grow increasingly grotesque and distorted.

➡️ The game has **3 different endings** depending on your choices.

## ✨ Key Features

* 🕯 **Short horror narrative**: 4 tense nights with branching choices.
* 🔀 **3 Endings**: based on your reports, trust levels, and actions.
* 🗨 **Multiple interactions**: pick up/examine items, chat with tenants, scan bodies, and use your weapon when necessary.
* 🎨 **Pixel art 2D**: eerie atmosphere with unsettling details.
* 💬 **Chatbox-driven gameplay**: interrogation and deduction through dialogue.
* 💻 **Cross-platform**: playable on **WebGL & PC**.

⚠️ **Content Warning**: Horror themes, body distortion, sudden audio/visual scares. Player discretion advised.
